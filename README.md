# TTPSchedules

This repo contains the code and data used for the paper _Too Constrained for Genetic Algorithms. Too Hard for Evolutionary Computing. The Traveling Tournament Problem._ by Kristian Verduin, Sarah L. Thomson and Daan van den Berg.

## Code

The script `violations.py` is used to generate the random schedules.

Run the script using `python violations.py [nr_teams] [nr_schedules]`

## Data

The data that was used is contained in the `Data` folder.

Folders `[0-4]` represent the run the data originates from.

The violations are stored in the format:

[maxStreakViolations]
[noRepeatViolatoins]
[doubleRoundRobinViolatoins]
[totalViolations]

## Figures

All figures (including bonus figures) can be found in the `Figures` folder.
